##Sign Up##

For any visitor that does not currently have an account and wishes to sign up on my website, I would like to direct them to a seaperate sign-up page which will contain the sign-up form.
When on the "/signup" page:
  - I would like a text-box for- name, email, preferred password and confirm password to be present.
  - Once the visitor enters all required information and clicks "continue", the user should be logged in automatically and redirected to the home page.
When invalid data is entered on the sign-up form:
  - I would like for the error validations to be clear when failed sign-up.
  - Also, i would like to repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).

##Log In##

As a registered user, I want the user to be able to log in to the website via a log-in form.
When I'm on the /login page:
  - I would like to be able to enter my email and password on a clearly laid out form.
  - I would like the website to log me in upon successful completion of the lob-up form.
    *So that I can seamlessly access the site's functionality
When I enter invalid data on the log-up form:
  - I would like the website to inform me of the validations I failed to pass, and repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).
    * So that I can try again without needing to refill forms I entered valid data into.
